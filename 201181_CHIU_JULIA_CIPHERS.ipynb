    "Start with a message, such as \"ATTACK AT DAWN\".\n",
    "Choose a number, such as 3.\n",
    "Shift all letters in the message to the right by the chosen number. In this case, shifting all letters in \"ATTACK AT DAWN\" by 3 results in the message \"DWWDFN DW GDZQ\".\n",
    "Write a function called problem_1 that takes two positional arguments message and shift. It should apply the Caesar cipher to a message and return the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example input/output:\n",
    "problem_1(\"ATTACK AT DAWN\", 3) => \"DWWDFN DW GDZQ\"\n",

    "The function must ignore spaces.\n",
    "The function must be able to \"wrap around\" if it reaches the end of the alphabet. (e.g., shifting Z by 1 should result in A, shifting Z by 2 should result in B, etc.)\n",

    "Be aware of the ord() function. ord() takes a Unicode character and returns the Unicode code associated with that character (e.g., ord(\"A\") => 65).\n",
    "Be aware that the Unicode codes of the uppercase English alphabet are Unicode codes 65 to 90, where 65 = A, 66 = B, ..., 90 = Z.\n",
